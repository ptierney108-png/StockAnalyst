# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

FINDINGS: (1) DMI+ Value Variation Test: All tested stocks (AAPL, MSFT) return identical DMI+ values of 22.00, confirming the bug where 'DMI component values for DMI+ do not update when different stocks are entered' ❌ (2) Stock Analysis Scenario (AAPL->GOOGL): Could not complete due to API timeouts, but AAPL and MSFT both show DMI+ = 22.00 ❌ (3) Point Based Decision Scenario (AAPL->MSFT): FAILED - both stocks return identical DMI+ = 22.00 instead of different values ❌ (4) Backend API Response: APIs are functional but DMI+ calculation appears to be using static/cached values rather than stock-specific calculations ❌ ROOT CAUSE: The DMI+ calculation in the backend is not properly varying between different stock symbols, likely due to static fallback values or caching issues in the calculate_dmi() function. IMPACT: This prevents users from getting accurate technical analysis when switching between stocks, making the DMI component unreliable for investment decisions.

DETAILED FINDINGS: (1) Stock Entry Sequence Test: AAPL DMI+ = 42.24, GOOGL DMI+ = 34.65, MSFT DMI+ = 21.34 - All DIFFERENT values ✅ (2) Comparison Analysis: 3 unique DMI+ values out of 3 stocks tested - No more identical values ✅ (3) Range Check: All DMI+ values within valid 0-100 range (42.24, 34.65, 21.34) ✅ (4) Backend Logs: Show proper DMI calculation with debug output 'DMI Calculated: DMI+=42.24, DMI-=17.38, ADX=41.70' for each stock ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED: The issue was in generate_dmi_history() function taking only 14 data points when calculate_dmi() requires 15 points (period + 1). Fixed by changing subset_data[-14:] to subset_data[-15:] in lines 428-430. TECHNICAL VALIDATION: Backend logs show 'DMI Calculated' messages with different values for each stock, using real Alpha Vantage data with 90+ data points. No more static 22.00 or 0.0 values. IMPACT RESOLVED: Users now get accurate, stock-specific DMI+ values when switching between stocks, making the DMI component reliable for investment decisions. The core user-reported bug 'DMI component values for DMI+ do not update when different stocks are entered' has been completely eliminated."

      message: "🚨 CRITICAL DMI+ VALUE VARIATION BUG CONFIRMED ✅ Comprehensive testing of the specific user scenarios from review request has validated the critical issue. FINDINGS: (1) DMI+ Value Variation Test: All tested stocks (AAPL, MSFT) return identical DMI+ values of 22.00, confirming the user-reported bug where 'DMI component values for DMI+ do not update when different stocks are entered' ❌ (2) Stock Analysis Scenario (AAPL->GOOGL): Could not complete due to API timeouts, but AAPL shows DMI+ = 22.00 ❌ (3) Point Based Decision Scenario (AAPL->MSFT): FAILED - both stocks return identical DMI+ = 22.00 instead of different values ❌ (4) Backend API Response: APIs are functional (response times 10-12s) but DMI+ calculation appears to be using static/cached values rather than stock-specific calculations ❌ ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The DMI+ calculation in the backend is not properly varying between different stock symbols, likely due to static fallback values or caching issues in the calculate_dmi() function in /app/backend/server.py. The generate_dmi_history() function may be using hardcoded values instead of calculating stock-specific DMI values. IMPACT: This prevents users from getting accurate technical analysis when switching between stocks, making the DMI component unreliable for investment decisions. URGENT RECOMMENDATION: Main agent must investigate and fix the DMI calculation logic to ensure stock-specific DMI+ values are calculated properly for each symbol."

      message: "🎉 DMI+ VALUE VARIATION FIX SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ✅ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING CONFIRMS COMPLETE RESOLUTION: All critical success criteria from review request achieved (100% success rate). DETAILED VALIDATION RESULTS: (1) Stock Entry Sequence Test: AAPL DMI+ = 42.24, GOOGL DMI+ = 34.65, MSFT DMI+ = 21.34 - All stocks return DIFFERENT DMI+ values ✅ (2) Comparison Analysis: 3 unique DMI+ values out of 3 stocks tested - No more identical static values ✅ (3) Range Check: All DMI+ values within valid 0-100 range and realistic for each stock's price data ✅ (4) Backend Logs Verification: Show proper calculation with debug output 'DMI Calculated: DMI+=42.24, DMI-=17.38, ADX=41.70' using real Alpha Vantage data ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED: The issue was in generate_dmi_history() function at lines 428-430 where only 14 data points were passed to calculate_dmi() but the function requires period + 1 (15 points). Fixed by changing subset_data[-14:] to subset_data[-15:]. TECHNICAL EVIDENCE: Backend logs now show 'DMI Calculated' messages with different values for each stock, enhanced debugging shows proper ATR and directional movement calculations. IMPACT RESOLVED: The core user-reported bug 'DMI component values for DMI+ do not update when different stocks are entered' has been completely eliminated. Users now receive accurate, stock-specific DMI+ values when switching between stocks, making the DMI component reliable for investment decisions. SUCCESS RATE: 4/4 critical criteria passed - COMPLETE SUCCESS!"
