The AI engineer was initially tasked with completing Phase 2 of the Batch Scanner, focusing on comprehensive market coverage, particularly for NASDAQ and NYSE. Initial attempts involved using  to fetch stock lists and then integrating them into . This approach faced repeated failures with file modification tools. A significant pivot occurred when the user suggested a Finnhub API-based approach. The AI engineer adopted this, creating  and integrating it into  and .

The integration involved adding  to . Post-integration, the engineer debugged server endpoints, ensured batch scanning could initiate, and fixed a critical inconsistency in stock counts displayed in the UI and backend responses, caused by a mismatch between static and dynamic Finnhub data. This was resolved by implementing proper index mapping. The batch scanner now runs with comprehensive, consistent stock counts and progress tracking. The last action was verifying partial results and noting the lack of automatic spreadsheet export.

The StockWise application, a Technical Analysis Platform, features manual stock entry, advanced charts with indicators (PPO, DMI, SMA, RSI, MACD), and a Point Based Decision system. User feedback drove improvements in PPO, DMI, AI recommendations, chart synchronization, and real stock data. A Stock Screener with price, DMI, and PPO slope filters was implemented.

Recent requirements focused on Scanner Enhancements (PPO hook, data source transparency, bug fixes), Data Quality (expanding stock universe, Alpha Vantage integration), and Technical Indicator Clarity. The primary ongoing feature is the Batch Scanner, designed for 75 calls/minute API rate limit, covering S&P 500, NASDAQ, NYSE, DOW 30 (6,300+ unique stocks) with on-demand user-triggered scans, cached results, live UI, background processing, and real-time partial results. Phase 1 (completed) covered S&P 500 with Redis, in-process queues, and the  page. Phase 2 (ongoing) is expanding to complete market coverage (NASDAQ, NYSE, now via Finnhub), configurable universe, and real-time partial results.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, interacting with a MongoDB database, now enhanced with Redis for caching and Finnhub for real-time stock data.



-   : Core FastAPI application.
    -   Importance: Manages API endpoints and business logic.
    -   Changes: Fixed a logger issue, integrated Finnhub stock universe functions, updated  and  endpoints to use dynamic Finnhub counts and proper index mapping, resolving stock count inconsistencies.
-   : Original module.
    -   Importance: Stored static stock symbols.
    -   Changes: No direct changes made during this trajectory as its function was superseded by .
-   : Core logic for batch scans.
    -   Importance: Handles rate limiting and queues for stock processing.
    -   Changes: Updated to import and utilize the new  for retrieving stock lists based on selected indices.
-   : Utility script.
    -   Importance: Used to download comprehensive stock lists from external sources.
    -   Changes: Executed successfully to download NASDAQ/NYSE lists, but its output was not fully integrated into  due to tooling issues, leading to the pivot to Finnhub.
-   : **NEW** Python module.
    -   Importance: Provides real-time, comprehensive stock symbols from Finnhub API, along with fundamentals, profiles, and earnings data. Includes Finnhub API key handling and a static S&P 500 fallback.
    -   Changes: Created to replace previous stock universe fetching methods.
-   : Python dependencies.
    -   Importance: Lists all required Python packages for the backend.
    -   Changes: Added  (for Finnhub API calls) and  (for S&P 500 Wikipedia scraping fallback).

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement functionality for automatic spreadsheet/CSV export of batch scan results. The current batch jobs produce data, but the export mechanism isn't explicit or automatic.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on completing Phase 2 of the Batch Scanner by integrating the Finnhub API for comprehensive market coverage and ensuring data consistency. The primary work involved:
1.  **Finnhub Integration**: A new file, , was created to fetch real-time, comprehensive stock data from the Finnhub API (NASDAQ: 14,939, NYSE: 13,883 stocks, etc.).
2.  **Codebase Updates**:  and  were modified to use this new Finnhub integration for fetching stock lists and processing.
3.  **Dependency Management**:  and  were added to  and installed.
4.  **Issue Resolution (Stock Count Inconsistency)**:
    *   The user reported inconsistent stock counts in the UI.
    *   The root cause was identified as a mismatch between static counts presented to the frontend and dynamic Finnhub data used in the backend.
    *   The  and  endpoints in  were updated to correctly map index names (e.g., SP500, NASDAQ_COMPREHENSIVE) to the appropriate Finnhub-derived stock counts.
    *   Extensive testing confirmed consistent stock counts across the frontend UI, backend API responses, and progress reporting for batch scans.
5.  **Current State**: The batch scanner is fully operational with Finnhub integration, displaying correct stock counts for various indices, processing stocks, and providing real-time progress updates and partial results. The last observed status of a batch job showed it was running and had processed 286 out of 499 stocks with 277 matching results. The AI engineer noted that spreadsheet/CSV export functionality is not automatically produced.

<optional_next_step>
Check for an existing export endpoint or implement a new one for CSV/spreadsheet export of batch scan results.
