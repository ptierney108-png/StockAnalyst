The AI engineer's primary task is to complete Phase 2 of the Batch Scanner, focusing on comprehensive market coverage. Initial efforts included bug fixes for the existing screener (DMI, PPO, Math.abs() issues). Phase 1 of the Batch Scanner was completed, integrating Redis, an in-process queue, and a UI for S&P 500. The current trajectory shows the engineer addressing the incomplete NASDAQ and NYSE stock coverage. The engineer successfully downloaded comprehensive stock lists (9,816 unique stocks) using . The subsequent work involved updating  with these large datasets, encountering initial tool usage issues, then using a bulk writer. The engineer is in the process of integrating the downloaded NASDAQ and NYSE symbols into .

<product_requirements>
The StockWise application has evolved into a Technical Analysis Platform from an initial Stock Analysis Application. Key features include manual stock entry, advanced charts with indicators (PPO, DMI, SMA, RSI, MACD), and a Point Based Decision system. User feedback led to improvements in PPO histograms, DMI data display, AI recommendations, chart synchronization, and real stock data integration. A Stock Screener was implemented with filters for price, DMI, and PPO slope.

Recent explicit requirements focused on:
1.  **Scanner Enhancements**: Implementing PPO hook filtering, data source transparency, fixing screener bugs (filtering logic, UI alignment), and resolving the Start Analysis button.
2.  **Data Quality**: Addressing demo data usage in various modules, expanding the stock universe, and integrating a paid Alpha Vantage API key.
3.  **Technical Indicator Clarity**: Clarifying settings and data sources, with options/earnings currently simulated.
4.  **Batch Scanner Development**: A new Batch Scanner was specified with a 75 calls/minute API rate limit, covering S&P 500, NASDAQ, NYSE, DOW 30 (6,300+ unique stocks). It features on-demand user-triggered scans with progress, cached results, multi-layer caching (in-memory, database), a live results UI, background processing via in-process queues, smart batching, and data freshness indicators.
    *   **Phase 1 (Completed)**: Core scanning with basic filters, S&P 500 only, MongoDB + Redis caching, in-process queues, and the  page.
    *   **Phase 2 (Ongoing)**: Expanding to complete market coverage (NASDAQ, NYSE, aiming for 6,300+ stocks), configurable universe, interleaved processing, and real-time partial results.

-   : Original Stock Screener UI. Changes include removing  from PPO slope filtering.
-   : Technical Analysis interface. Updated PPO slope formula display.
-   : Centralized Frontend API service. Added functions for batch scanner operations.
-   : **NEW** UI for Batch Scanner. Initial creation with UI for index selection, filters, progress, results, client-side CSV export, and real-time partial results.
-   : Main application component for routing. Added route for .
-   : Global navigation bar. Added link for Batch Screener.
-   : Backend Python dependencies. Added  and .
-   : **NEW** Python module. Stores static stock symbols. Currently being updated with comprehensive NASDAQ and NYSE lists.
-   : **NEW** Python module. Implements Redis caching for batch scan results.
-   : **NEW** Python module. Core logic for batch scans, rate limiting, and queues. Fixed rate limiter deadlock and updated  for Phase 2.
-   : **NEW** Python script. Utility to download comprehensive stock lists from external sources. It has successfully downloaded 4,198 NASDAQ and 5,618 NYSE stocks.
-   : Frontend utility for technical analysis. Removed  from PPO slope calculation.
-   : Frontend utility for mock stock data. Removed  from PPO slope calculation.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the implementation of Phase 2 of the Batch Scanner:
    -   Process and integrate the downloaded comprehensive stock lists for NASDAQ and NYSE into .
    -   Ensure the batch scanner can effectively scan the expanded universe of 9,816+ stocks.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was focused on fulfilling the Complete market coverage objective of Batch Scanner Phase 2. The user had identified that previous NASDAQ and NYSE stock lists were incomplete.

The AI engineer addressed this by:
1.  **Creating and executing **: This script successfully downloaded 4,198 NASDAQ and 5,618 NYSE stock symbols, totaling 9,816 unique stocks, which is a comprehensive dataset.
2.  **Updating **: The engineer is actively engaged in integrating these newly acquired comprehensive lists into the  module. Initial attempts to use  failed due to incorrect parameter usage ( or  missing), but a bulk file write operation was subsequently successful for a portion of the update. The engineer is now continuing to update  with the full NYSE list, noting a need to truncate the data when inserting due to potential length limitations for sample representation. The existing Batch Screener UI is already prepared for index selection and partial results, but the backend requires these updated comprehensive stock lists to enable full market scanning.
