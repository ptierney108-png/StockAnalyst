The AI engineer's work on the StockWise application has been a rigorous process of continuous improvement, primarily driven by direct user feedback in the form of bug reports and feature requests. Key architectural enhancements included implementing aggressive caching, API rate limiting with circuit breakers, and comprehensive data source transparency indicators across all pages. The engineer addressed critical PPO calculation inaccuracies by introducing adaptive logic for limited data and corrected numerous UI/UX issues, such as chart value discrepancies, default timeframe settings, and non-functional buttons. A significant focus was on migrating the stock screener from simulated to real data, resolving complex filtering logic, and expanding the stock universe. Troubleshooting often required deep dives into both frontend (React state management, prop mismatches) and backend (technical indicator formulas, filter application), occasionally leveraging a  for complex issues. This trajectory exemplifies iterative problem-solving with thorough testing and constant user communication.

The StockWise application was initially a Stock Analysis Application that evolved into a Technical Analysis Platform with features like manual stock entry, advanced charts, technical indicators (PPO, DMI, SMA, RSI, MACD), PPO slope, AI recommendations, and sentiment analysis. It expanded to include a Point Based Decision system for stock recommendations. User feedback led to PPO histogram improvements, DMI as tabular data, enhanced AI recommendations, fixed chart timeframe synchronization, and real stock data for the Dashboard. Subsequently, a Stock Screener was developed for filtering by price, DMI, and PPO slope (3-day), featuring extensive results and robust data simulation. Recent critical requirements included PPO hook filtering, ensuring data source transparency on all pages, fixing numerous bugs in the screener (e.g., filtering, PPO 3-day data, options/earnings population, UI alignment), resolving the Start Analysis button functionality, addressing demo data usage in Market, Point Based Decision, Portfolio, and Watchlist, expanding the stock universe, and integrating a paid Alpha Vantage API key. The user also explicitly requested clarification on technical indicator settings and data sources for options and earnings.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing several critical issues reported by the user, specifically concerning the stock screener's filtering logic and the data sources for options and earnings.

1.  **Scanner Filtering Logic Fix**: The user reported that scanner results did not meet the specified DMI and PPO Slope criteria, and expected negative hooks were missing.
    *   The backend's filtering logic in  was corrected. The DMI filter was adjusted to use ADX for strength, and the  function was removed from the PPO slope filter to correctly handle negative slope minimums (Chat Message 607).
    *   The backend was also found to be entirely missing the PPO hook pattern filtering logic. This logic was implemented, adding  to the  model and integrating the detection logic (Chat Message 626). The PPO slope filter was further adjusted to properly handle negative minimums (Chat Message 628).
    *   Backend testing confirmed that the scanner's filtering, including DMI, PPO slope, and PPO hook patterns, now works correctly (Chat Message 614, 633).

2.  **Options and Earnings Data Source Clarification**: The user questioned the authenticity of options and earnings data, noting it appeared fake (Chat Message 575, 548).
    *   The AI engineer confirmed that, currently, **all options and earnings data is 100% simulated/calculated in the backend**, not fetched from real APIs.
    *   Potential real data sources (Polygon.io, IEX Cloud, Alpha Vantage) were listed.
    *   The engineer explicitly asked the user if they wanted to proceed with integrating real options and earnings data, which would entail API key setup, backend integration, and cost considerations (Chat Message 597). Data source transparency indicators in the frontend and backend were updated for clarity (Chat Message 590, 561-567).

The most recent successful fixes were for the scanner's filtering logic. The next step is awaiting user confirmation on integrating real options/earnings data.
