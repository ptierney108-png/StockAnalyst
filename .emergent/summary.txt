The AI engineer's work on the StockWise application has been characterized by iterative development and constant adaptation to evolving user requirements and bug fixes. Initially, the focus was on establishing a Technical Analysis Platform with charts and AI recommendations, which faced significant challenges including UI rendering, syntax errors, and routing conflicts that inadvertently overwrote components. This led to a major refactoring effort to correctly separate Technical Analysis and a new Point Based Decision system.

Subsequent work addressed user feedback on chart elegance (PPO histogram, DMI as tabular data), AI recommendation detail, and critical bug reports concerning chart timeframe functionality and dashboard data population. The AI successfully implemented multiple data source fallbacks (Alpha Vantage, Polygon.io, Yahoo Finance, enhanced mock data) to ensure data reliability despite API limitations.

The latest major undertaking involved developing a multi-phase Stock Screener application, which has progressed through three phases, establishing its interface, integrating advanced technical calculations (DMI, PPO slope), and creating a comprehensive, user-friendly results display with robust data simulation and UX features. The trajectory concludes with the completion of Phase 3 of the Stock Screener, awaiting user review.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a Stock Analysis Application (StockWise) initially. This evolved into a Technical Analysis Platform featuring manual stock entry, advanced charts (candlestick, multiple timeframes), technical indicators (PPO, DMI, SMA, RSI, MACD), PPO slope calculations, AI recommendations (buy/hold/sell), sentiment analysis, and volume analysis using ApexCharts. Subsequent requests included a Point Based Decision tab for a Stock Recommendation System with a scoring algorithm (price momentum, P/E, RSI, moving average), deterministic simulation, intelligent explanations (5-6 lines), professional UI (color-coded, Lucide React icons, card layout), and robust state handling.

Ongoing feedback necessitated improving PPO histogram elegance, converting DMI display to a tabular/card format (similar to 3-day PPO components), enhancing AI recommendations with fundamental data and detailed sentiment drivers, fixing chart timeframe synchronization, and populating the Dashboard with real stock data. Most recently, a Stock Screener was requested to filter stocks by price range, DMI indicators, and PPO slope (3-day), featuring a comprehensive results table with extensive stock, options, and earnings data, robust data simulation, and advanced UX features like real-time validation, loading states, error handling, educational tooltips, and export functionality.

</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had completed **Phase 3: Comprehensive Results Display & Enhanced User Experience Features** for the **Stock Screener** application.

The work involved:
1.  **Comprehensive Results Table**: Updating  to display a detailed, sortable table. This table includes columns for stock symbol, description/name, price, volume today, volume 3 months, volume for year, 1 day return, 5 day return, 2 week return, 1 month return, 1 year return, DMI indicator value, past 3 days of PPO indicator values, calculated PPO slope percentage, sector, industry, optionable status, at-the-money call/put bid/ask prices for nearest expiration, last earnings date, next earnings date, and days until next earnings.
2.  **Color-Coded Indicators**: Implementing visual indicators (e.g., green/red for positive/negative returns/slopes) and highlighting stocks with upcoming earnings (within 7 days) in the results table.
3.  **Export Functionality**: Adding an Export Results button.
4.  **Educational Tooltips**: Integrating tooltips for DMI and PPO indicators, providing explanations for user learning.
5.  **Enhanced Loading States and Performance Feedback**: Refining the UI to show clear loading indicators during scans and potentially performance metrics.

This phase built upon the  component, which now integrates the  and  utilities for its core logic and data. The engineer provided a preview link and is awaiting user review and feedback on this completed phase.
